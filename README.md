# Pairs Trading Backtest – NSE Equities

This repository contains my research project on **cointegration-based pairs trading** conducted during my Data Science Internship at **Motilal Oswal Financial Services (Jul–Sep 2025)**.  

Using historical NSE data, I built a **Python backtesting framework** to test 50+ equity pairs. The framework applies **cointegration testing, spread analysis, and entry/exit thresholds** to simulate long/short positions. Results include portfolio performance comparisons between **baseline vs. optimized selection methods**, with actionable insights for strategy deployment.
